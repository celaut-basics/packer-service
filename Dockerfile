# Celaut builds this image only to export its filesystem (docker buildx
# --output type=tar); the container is never run by Docker directly. CMD/
# ENTRYPOINT/EXPOSE are intentionally omitted — the entrypoint, ports and envs
# are declared in service.json. The packed service runs as a cloud-hypervisor
# microVM whose init runs /app/start.sh.
#
# Base = docker-in-docker: this is what lets the packer service do "the same as
# nodo pack" from *inside* a sealed microVM — it boots its own dockerd and runs
# `docker buildx build` to compile the image being packed. That nested build is
# why the service declares network: tag=(*) (buildx must pull base images).
