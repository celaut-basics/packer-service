# Celaut builds this image only to export its filesystem (docker buildx
# --output type=tar); the container is never run by Docker directly. CMD/
# ENTRYPOINT/EXPOSE are intentionally omitted — the entrypoint, ports and envs
# are declared in service.json. The packed service runs as a cloud-hypervisor
# microVM whose init runs /app/start.sh.
#
# This service does "the same as `nodo pack`" from INSIDE a sealed microVM: it
# boots its own native dockerd inside the guest and runs `docker buildx build`
# to compile the image being packed. That nested build is why service.json
# declares network: tag=(*) (buildx must pull base images).
#
# WHY A GLIBC (debian) BASE AND NOT docker:27-dind (alpine):
#   The packer vendors nodo, whose protobuf stack (bee_rpc's generated *_pb2)
#   requires protobuf's C backend (`google._upb`). protobuf 4.23.3 ships no
#   musllinux wheel with that extension, so on Alpine `import bee_rpc` dies with
#   "No module named 'google._upb'". On glibc the manylinux wheel provides it.
#   We still FORCE pure-python protobuf at runtime (see ENV below) for a stable,
#   deterministic xattrs-map serialization — but the package must be importable,
#   which needs glibc. The Docker engine itself is static, so we lift its
#   binaries out of the official docker:27-dind image (pinned by digest).

# The packer source lives IN-REPO under src/ (self-contained — no clone of nodo
# at build time). It carries the exact transitive import closure of the packer
# worker `src.packers.zip_with_dockerfile`: the packer itself plus its
# src.utils / src.manager.resources deps and the whole protos/ package. This
# tree is maintained here now (originally derived from nodo, but independent of
# it). The outer src/ mirrors the /opt/nodo payload; the inner src/ is the
# Python package root. See src/README.md.

# binaries exactly there (after the src COPY, so the dir merges cleanly).

# Determinism patches are now BAKED into the packer source (search for
# "DETERMINISM PATCH" in src/). They make this service's ids match
# `nodo pack` on a patched node, and make repeated packs reproducible:
#   1. recursive_parsing sorts os.listdir() so filesystem branch order (hence
#      serialized bytes) is stable across extractions of the same tar.
#   2. mtime_ns is normalised to 0 (tar reassigns symlink mtimes to wall-clock
#      time, which would otherwise change the id every pack).
# A third fix (correctness, not determinism) is baked in the same way: the packer
# runs `docker buildx build` with cwd=self.path (the build-context dir) but the
# --output dest and the context arg were CACHE-relative, so under that cwd they
# double-nested — buildx couldn't find the context / write filesystem.tar, and
# every pack failed with HTTP 400. Both are absolutized now (os.path.abspath).
# Assert all three are present so a regression in the source fails the build.

# No config.yaml. A config file makes sense on a full nodo, but not for a
# single-purpose service — the determinism-critical values are hardcoded in the
# source instead: hash spec = sha3_256 (src/utils/hashing.py DEFAULT_HASH_NAME),
# MIN_BUFFER_BLOCK_SIZE = 10 MiB (src/packers/zip_with_dockerfile.py), and packer
# arch support (src/utils/runtime.py PACKER_SUPPORTED_ARCHITECTURES). Runtime dirs
# come from start.sh env (CACHE / BLOCKDIR). So the service still packs
# byte-identically to `nodo pack`, with nothing to keep in sync.
