# Celaut builds this image only to export its filesystem (docker buildx
# --output type=tar); the container is never run by Docker directly. CMD/
# ENTRYPOINT/EXPOSE are intentionally omitted — the entrypoint, ports and envs
# are declared in service.json. The packed service runs as a cloud-hypervisor
# microVM whose init runs /app/start.sh.
#
# Base = docker-in-docker: this is what lets the packer service do "the same as
# nodo pack" from *inside* a sealed microVM — it boots its own dockerd and runs
# `docker buildx build` to compile the image being packed. That nested build is
# why the service declares network: tag=(*) (buildx must pull base images).

# expat are both reconciled to the same consistent v3.21 snapshot, THEN add the

#   2. it hashes mtime_ns, but tar extraction reassigns SYMLINK mtimes to the
#      current wall-clock time, so the id changes every pack.
# Both are content-irrelevant; normalise them. (Report upstream.)

# Two pins matter for a byte-identical service-id:
#   * protobuf==4.23.3 — the metadata serializer; matches the node's runtime and

#   * bee_rpc @ the exact git commit the node uses — owns the multiblock/.bee
#     block format that the id is hashed over.
# bee_rpc HARD-pins grpcio==1.56.0 + protobuf==4.23.3 in its metadata, but
# grpcio 1.56.0 has no cp312/musllinux wheel and would force a slow, fragile
# source build. grpcio is only the block-streaming transport underneath bee_rpc
# — it contributes no bytes to the hashed content — so we install bee_rpc with
# --no-deps and supply a wheel-shipping grpcio ourselves, while keeping protobuf
